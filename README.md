A quick look at the top-level files and directories in project.

    .
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── .eslintrc
    ├── .prettierrc
    └── README.md

- **`/public`**: This directory will contain index.html, manifest and bundled code

- **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

- **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

- **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

- **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

- **`.eslintrc`**: linter (eslint) configuration file

- **`.prettierrc`**: code formatter (prettier) configuration file
